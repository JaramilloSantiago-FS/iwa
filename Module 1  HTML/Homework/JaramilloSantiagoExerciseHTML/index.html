          <strong>The history of association football</strong>, more commonly
          known as <strong>football</strong> or <strong>soccer</strong>,
          stretches back to at least medieval times.[1][2][3] FIFA cites Cuju in
          ancient China is the earliest form of a kicking game for which there
          is scientific evidence, a military manual from the Han dynasty, and it
          closely resembles modern association football. Similar games were
          played in ancient Japan, Greece, and Rome.[4] The first written
          evidence of a football match came in England in about 1170.

        <p>
          <strong>The development of association football</strong> has its
          origins in <em>medieval ball games</em> and English public school
          games. The modern game of association football originated in the
          mid-nineteenth century by the efforts of English football clubs to
          standardize the varying sets of football rules, culminating in the
          formation of The Football Association (The FA) in London, England, in
          1863, and their issuing of<em> the Laws of the Game</em> in the same
          year.[5][6] The "Laws of the Game" were later trusted to the
          International Football Association Board (IFAB) and then adopted by
          the International association football Federation (FIFA). This set of
          rules drafted by The FA allowed clubs to play each other without
          dispute, and banned a number of contentious practices, notably both
          hacking and handling of the ball (except by goalkeepers) during open
          play. After the fifth meeting of the Association, a schism emerged
          between association football and the football played by the rules of
          the Rugby School, which later became rugby football.

          Besides its dedicated competitions, football has also been an Olympic
          sport since the second modern Summer Olympic Games in Paris, France,
          in 1900.[7]

          <strong>The laws of the game</strong> agreed on by the FA members
          stipulated a maximum length and breadth for the pitch, the procedure
          for kicking off, and the definition of terms, including goal, throw
          in, and offside. Passing the ball by hand was still permitted provided
          the ball was caught <em> "fairly or on the first bounce"</em>. Despite
          the specifications of footwear having no
          <em>"tough nails, iron plates and gutta percha"</em> there were no
          specific rules on the number of players, penalties, foul play or the
          shape of the ball; captains of the participating teams were expected
          to agree on these things prior to the match.

        <p>
          The laws laid down by the FA had an immediate effect, with
          <strong>Sheffield F.C.</strong> and Nottingham (now Notts County)
          playing an annual fixture on the FA code, among others. As more teams
          joined the code in the 1860s, the sport veered away from its origins
          in public schools and came to be played with round balls and by teams
          that had settled on 11 players each. The rule eliminating passing of
          the ball forwards by making all players in front of the ball
          <em>"offside"</em> (much like in rugby today) was dropped. A Sheffield
          against London game in 1866 had allowed the FA to observe how the
          rules were affecting the game; subsequently handling of the ball was
          abolished except for one player on each team, the <em>goalkeeper</em>.
          A red tape was added between the two goalposts to indicate the top of
          the goal, and a national competition was proposed. 1867 saw the
          introduction of the first competition and oldest existing trophy in
          football, the Youdan Cup.

        <h3>First FA Cup</h3>
        <p>
          On 20 July 1871, C. W. Alcock, a gentleman from Sunderland and a
          former pupil of Harrow School proposed that "a Challenge Cup should be
          established in connection with the [Football] Association",[19] the
          idea that gave birth to the competition.
          <strong>At the first FA Cup in 1872</strong>, Wanderers and Royal
          Engineers met in the final in front of 2,000 paying spectators.[20]
          Despite the Royal Engineers being the heavy favourites, one of their
          players sustained a broken collar bone early on and since
          substitutions had not yet been introduced, the Engineers played a man
          down for the rest of the match which they eventually lost 1–0.[21]

        <p>
          The success of the inaugural FA Cup lead many English clubs to apply
          to take part. Inclusion required playing by the newly instituted FA
          code, which led to the quick spread of a universal set of rules. These
          rules are the basis of which all association football rules today
          stem.[22]
        </p>

        <p>
          Later competitions saw the 'Gentleman' or Southerners dominate with
          Old Etonians, Wanderers, Royal Engineers and Oxford University who
          amongst them took 19 titles.[23] Queens Park withdrew in the
          semi-finals of the 1873 cup (which due to the format being played that
          year meant that all the challengers to Wanderers' trophy played a
          competition for the right to throw down the gauntlet and play the
          holders, hence the full name FA Challenge Cup) because they had
          trouble raising travel expenses to pay for the constant trips to
          England, this directly led to the formation of the Scottish FA.
          However, despite this, Queens Park continued to participate in the FA
          Cup, reaching the final twice, before the Scottish FA banned Scottish
          clubs from entering in 1887.[23]

          In 1872, Alcock purchased a trophy for the Football Association Cup
          for £20.[24] That year, fifteen clubs entered the competition. Queen's
          Park reached the semi-finals without playing due to withdrawals, but
          then after a goalless draw with Wanderers, were forced to withdraw as
          before the advent of penalties and extra time, they could not afford
          to come back to London for the replay. Wanderers won the cup outright
          in 1878 after what remains to this day one of only two hat tricks of
          wins ever. However, they returned the cup to the FA in order for the
          competition to continue, on the condition that no other club could win
          the cup outright ever again.

        <h3>First International Cup</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>The first international game </strong> was played in Scotland
          on 30 November 1872. Charles Alcock, who was elected to secretary of
          the FA at the age of 28, devised the idea of an international
          competition, inaugurating an annual Scotland-England fixture. In 1870
          and 1871 he placed advertisements in Edinburgh and Glasgow newspapers,
          requesting players for an international between the two countries. The
          only response that he received stated: "devotees of the "association"
          rules will find no foemen worthy of their steel in Scotland"[26] For
          this reason the 1870 and 1871 matches were composed entirely of Scots
          living in England. Notably, however, Smith of the Queen's Park
          football club took part in most of the 1870 and 1871 international
          matches. As early as 1870, Alcock was adamant that these matches were
          open to every Scotsman [Alcock's italics] whether his lines were cast
          North or South of the Tweed and that if in the face of the invitations
          publicly given through the columns of leading journals of Scotland the
          representative eleven consisted chiefly of Anglo-Scotians ... the
          fault lies on the heads of the players of the north, not on the
          management who sought the services of all alike impartially. To call
          the team London Scotchmen contributes nothing. The match was, as
          announced, to all intents and purposes between England and
          Scotland".[27]
